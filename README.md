# SQL Murder Mystery
A SQL DB containing a murder case! Different tables have clues distributed among them to help catch the killer. A fun way to practice and learn SQL!

It's preferred that SQL queries be used to solve this puzzle. The database file present in the data folder can be download and queried using a RDBMS (Relational Database Management System).
However, if participants are not comfortable using SQL they can use the Python and R starter scripts inside the Started Code folder.

The schema.png file describes the schema of each table and the connections between them.

Read the prompt.pdf file to get started! Have fun!

P.S.: After finding the suspect, make sure to double check! Think of it as an actual murder case. Don't jump to conclusions!
